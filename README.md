### DriverPass Project Summary
The DriverPass project aimed to improve driving education by offering online courses and live instruction. The client, DriverPass, identified a significant problem with over 65% of people failing their driving tests at the DMV. Through this project, the goal was to provide better training and increase the pass rate for driving tests.

### Strengths
One aspect of my work that I believe I excelled at was creating clear and informative diagrams. Throughout the course, I developed a strong ability to analyze systems and represent abstract concepts visually. The diagrams I created, including classes, activities, sequences, and data flow, provided clarity and insight into the project's structure.

### Areas for Improvement
If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the UML class diagram. While documenting accessor methods was straightforward, I recognize the need for more depth in capturing the interrelated nature of classes. Adding additional methods that address these complexities would enhance the diagram's comprehensiveness.

### User Needs and System Design
Interpreting user needs was central to my system design approach. I crafted diagrams to reflect likely user interactions, leveraging sequence and activity diagrams to anticipate class utilization. Considering user needs ensures that the system design remains practical and aligned with the problems it aims to solve.

### Design Approach
My approach to software design emphasizes an iterative process. Rather than capturing all details upfront, I focus on making repetitive passes over the project, gradually incorporating deeper insights and additional details with each iteration. This iterative approach allows for flexibility and refinement, ensuring the final product meets user requirements effectively.
